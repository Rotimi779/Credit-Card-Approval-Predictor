# Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor


## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting credit card approval outcomes using machine learning. The dataset used in this analysis is from a credit card approval dataset which contains various attributes related to credit card applications. The goal is to build a classification model that predicts whether a credit card application will be approved or not based on these attributes. We use several preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
   - Data preprocessing: Handle missing values and ensure the data is in a suitable format for modeling.
   - Model Training and Evaluation: Create a pipeline that includes data scaling and logistic regression and evaluate the model's performance using confusion matrix and classification report.
   - Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different regularization strengths (C), penalty types, and solvers for the logistic regression to identify the optimal parameters.

## Requirements
Ensure  you have the following dependencies installed:
   - Python 3.x
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rotimi779/Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor.git
cd Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use this repository, follow the following steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rotimi779/Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics
- Confusion Matrix: Provides a summary of prediction results with counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, and f1-score for each class, as well as overall accuracy.

The model achieved the following results:
